This directory contains Amber forcefield parameters for Peptide Nucleic Acids with optimized backbone torsions described in:
Jasinski, M.; Feig, M.; Trylska, J.; JCTC 2018; DOI 10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00291
The file with corrected torsion angles parameters is: ./LIB/pna_par.opt3.frcmod

The basic parameters for PNA in Amber forcefield are based on two previous works on MD simulations of PNA.
Partial charges were computed by Rathinavelan and Yathindra[1] and backbone atom types introduced by Orozco et al.[2]. 
The Rathinavelan and Yathindra set is the first complete set of published charges for PNA within the Amber family and has been used previously for single-stranded PNA [3] in addition to double-stranded PNA[1].
These parameters are included in the LIB folder.

The directory contains also an example, prepared with Amber16, showing how to prepare a simulation of a PNA:RNA crystal structure (5EMF).
It uses a PDB file with PNA:RNA coplex only (5emf_noh.pdb), to prepare simulation box with water and ions and all necessary parameters.
To run it, change the location of your Amber (AmberTools) distribution in the tleap.sh script and run it.
If the script runs correctly, it will produce the following files: 5emf.crd  5emf.prm  5emf.amber.pdb  leap.log
Example outputs are in folder example_outputs
